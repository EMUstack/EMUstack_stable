Hi!

BlochCode can calculate Bloch modes, Bloch factors and impedances for 2D
Photonic Crystals with up-down symmetry. To do this, it needs to be given
electric and magnetic field data sampled throughout the PC at the frequency,
incident angle, and polarization of interest.


The extensive human-readable documentation for BlochCode lives in doc/_build/html/ and as a PDF in doc/_build/latex/

Example Sage notebook files are provided in the examples folder.  You will need to adjust the paths in the notebook to point to your BlochCode installation.


OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
------------------------------

BlochCode is most thoroughly tested on Mac OS X, running inside Sage <http://sagemath.org>.  On the Mac, it is also known to work with Enthought Python Distribution 7.1.

BlochCode has also been successfully run inside Sage on Linux, and should also work with Enthought Python Distribution (or other recent distributions of Numpy and Scipy).

It is currently unknown whether BlochCode works with Windows.  It can probably be made to work with Enthought on Windows with little effort -- but this is still uncharted territory.


TESTING
-------

BlochCode comes with a range of unit tests to ensure it is running correctly.  These are found in the tests directory.


HELP!
-----

Limited community support is available on the Launchpad site: <https://launchpad.net/blochcode>.  Feel free to ask questions.


CONTRIBUTING
------------

If you make an improvement to BlochCode, please share it with others by contributing back to the project, via the Launchpad site.
