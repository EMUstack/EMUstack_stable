Download gmsh source folder, & unzip/tar/etc

Download cmake sourse folder, & unzip/tar/etc

Follow gmsh_source/README.txt, with the following options to avoid non-standard libraries (only required for GUI anyway) and to install it into an appropriate directory (one you have write acces to);
cmake -DENABLE_FLTK=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt ..




Process used on NCI machine Raijin;

* If there is a file 'cmake' in gmsh-source/build/ remove/rename it.

* module load cmake

Make sure the mkl module is loaded.
In the CMakeLists.txt file in the base directory, make the following changes:
under
if(ENABLE_BLAS_LAPACK)
...
    elseif(${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} MATCHES "Linux")
       if(HAVE_64BIT_SIZE_T)
           set(MKL_PATH lib/em64t)
change (the 2 occurances of)
set(MKL_PATH lib/em64t) to
set(MKL_PATH mklroot/lib/intel64)
where mklroot is the output of the command 'echo $MKLROOT' i.e. the absolute path the the MKL libraries (CMake can't/won't read environment variables). Still under elseif(${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} MATCHES "Linux"), change
set(MKL_LIBS_REQUIRED mkl_gf_lp64 iomp5 mkl_gnu_thread mkl_core guide pthread) to
set(MKL_LIBS_REQUIRED mkl_core mkl_sequential mkl_intel_lp64)

Still under elseif(${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} MATCHES "Linux"), change
find_all_libraries(LAPACK_LIBRARIES MKL_LIBS_REQUIRED "" ${MKL_PATH}) to
find_all_libraries(LAPACK_LIBRARIES MKL_LIBS_REQUIRED ${MKL_PATH} "")

On using the cmake command you should see
Found Blas(IntelMKL)
Found Lapack(IntelMKL)




cmake -DENABLE_FLTK=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/562/bxs562/gmsh ..
make
make install

add gmsh to your path
in my .cshrc file (.bashrs will be similar but different) add the line
set path=( /home/562/bxs562/gmsh/bin $path ) 


* To test the installation, run
  $ which gmsh 
  in the command line, which should give the path to the instal, eg.
  $ /home/562/bxs562/gmsh/bin/gmsh

  gmsh can be launched by executing
  $ gmsh
