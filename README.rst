Welcome to EMUstack!
--------------------

EMUstack is an open-source simulation package for calculating light propagation through multi-layered stacks of dispersive, lossy, nanostructured, optical media. It implements a generalised scattering matrix method, which extends the physical intuition of thin film optics to complex structures.


ORIGIN
------

EMUstack is the product of many years research, and is designed primarily as a research tool.
The underpinnings of EMUstack were majoritively developed within CUDOS (the ARC Centre of Excellence for Ultra-high bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems), at its University of Sydney (USyd) and University of Technology Sydney (UTS) nodes.

The scattering matrix method formalism was developed by Lindsay Botten, Ara Asatryan, and Kokou Dossou at UTS. The FEM routine was developed by Kokou Dossou while at the Université du Québec en Outaouais, Université Laval and UTS.

EMUstack was written by Björn Sturmberg during his Ph.D. at USyd, which was supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. THE FEM routine was written by Kokou Dossou, and Felix Lawrence created the smooth f2py interface of Fortran and Python while at UTS.

OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
------------------------------

EMUstack has been developed for use on Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It may be easily ported to other operating systems, but there are no current plans for doing so. If you are willing and able to do so, please get in contact!


TESTING
-------

EMUstack comes with a range of tests to ensure it is running correctly. These are found in the EMUstack/tests directories.
